									Our predictions are presented in standard point spread
									format. The team with the negative number is the favorite,
									while the positive number indicates the underdog. The number
									represents the point spread, and the odds (expressed as
									-110) indicate the amount needed to win $100.

								Why Utilize Pickswise Expert Free Picks?

							<div class="spollers__body">
								<p>
									The short answer to ‘what makes a great free sports pick’
									for many people is…one that wins!
								</p>
								<p>
									To find winning expert plays we utilize a strategy of going
									‘beyond the spread.’ This involves taking into account more
									than just trends and the injury report. For instance, is too
									much of the public betting on one side? Is there strange
									line movement, no line movement when there should be or is
									the wrong team favored? What are some other factors to
									consider such as the last game of a long MLB or NBA road
									trip or arriving in town late and playing an early game?
									There are so many variables that can push a game one way or
									the other which is why in-depth handicapping of every game
									is so important.
								</p>
								<p>
									Another thing to know is that the best betting tips have
									years and years of experience behind them. Learning how to
									read lines and to look beyond the spread is a skill and it’s
									one that’s usually developed from years of winning – and
									losing. The goal of our free betting tips is to use the
									knowledge that we’ve learned from decades in sports wagering
									and pass it on to you to help build your bankroll with our
									free picks. A fast track way to sports betting success so to
									speak.
