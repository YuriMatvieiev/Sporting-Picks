							Information That We Automatically Collect
						</div>
						<p>
							As you use and access our Site, we and our service providers

						<p>
							<b>Usage Information:</b> Please be aware that our Site collects
							usage data, such as the source address from which a page request
							originates (i.e., your IP address, domain name, type of
							computer), date and time of the page request, the referring web
							site (if any), and other parameters in the URL (e.g., search
							criteria). We use this data, for instance, to better understand
							our Site usage in the aggregate so that we know which areas our
							Site users prefer (e.g., based on the number of visits to those
							areas). This information is stored in log files and is used for
							aggregated and statistical reporting. It is not attributed to
							you as an individual (i.e., log files are not associated with
							any particular user, computer, or browser). We also collect
							information through defect-tracking services, database and/or
							monitoring services, and error monitoring services (Atlassian,
							Rollbar) to fix errors which occur on the Site;
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Location Information:</b> We collect and process general
							information about the location of the device from which you are
							accessing the Site (e.g., approximate geographic location
							inferred from an IP address).
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Cookies and Browser Information:</b> iRival Media uses
							cookies for a variety of purposes. A cookie is a name for tokens
							of information that our Site may provide to your browser while
							you are at the Site. Cookies are stored on your device’s hard
							drive and, once placed there, the cookie will remain until you
							remove it. We use cookies for a variety of purposes, including
							but not limited to (a) helping us keep track of the items that
							you add to a watchlist, information you add to a profile, or
							items you place in your shopping cart; (b) helping us to better
							understand our Site usage in the aggregate so that we know what
							areas of the Site users prefer; and (c) to collect information
							that will help us customize content specific to your interests
							and make your navigation of our Site easier during subsequent
							visits. We also use cookies when you register for our user
							account to authenticate you and provide you access to those
							areas of the Site and to simplify your data entry for some of
							our online forms. We may also use temporary or “session” cookies
							to help you learn more about and/or order our services. If you
							simply want to browse, you do not have to accept cookies from
							the Site. Should you decide that you would like to register and
							login to special areas of the Site and you have modified your
							browser settings not to accept cookies, you will need to reset
							your browser to accept the cookies that we send it. Otherwise,
							you may not be able to participate in certain areas of the Site.
							Most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain cookies.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Web Beacons:</b> Web beacons (also known as “web bugs”) are
							strings of code that provide a method of delivering a graphic
							image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of
							transferring data. We may use web beacons on our Site or include
							them in the email messages we send. We use these for many
							purposes, including site traffic reporting, unique visitor
							counts, advertising email auditing and reporting, and
							personalization. Information gathered through web beacons may be
							linked to your Personal Information.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>IP Addresses and Log Files:</b> An Internet Protocol (“IP”)
							address is a number assigned to each computer on a network to
							identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet. We
							may keep track of IP addresses to troubleshoot technical
							concerns and to maintain the safety and security of our Site,
							such as by reviewing your IP address in combination with your
							Personal Information for credit fraud protection and risk
							reduction. In addition, we may use IP addresses to analyze
							trends, administer this Site, track traffic patterns, and gather
							demographic information for aggregate use.
